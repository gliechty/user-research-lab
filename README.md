## Notes: Cocktail builder- thought + would trigger dropdown, didn't like lack of .focus() --- "sucks. Doesn't work."
## Notes: Makemeacocktail- much more intuitive, liked how it provided a shopping list and saved session for a long time.

## Interviewee #2 (age 26, M, - my friend)
### Profile: bachelor, downtown apartment,
#### 1) Whiskey Sour, G/T, 
#### - Yes
#### - Cheap, easy. Enjoys the craftmanship.
#### 2) Yes
-Vodka, Tequila, Burbon, Wine
-4x a year, barely
#### 3) Microbrew Beer - Upslope
#### 4) 3 times
#### 6) A few drinks + a fridge full of other options
#### 7) 4
#### 8) something with vodka
#### 9) 15
#### 10) ~10

## Notes: Loves cocktails, but not a fan of looking up how to do it, not loving the interface....more of an on the fly kind of guy. Has plenty of bottles, but dislikes downloading and doing new things.

#### Takeaways
### This app could be successful (with good marketing, of course)...given a few changes to the sites considered.

####1) The look needs to be more visual. Pictures of drinks will help.

####2) It needs to be simple, and work well with mobile. Only pages for drinks you can make and a few extra ingredients to buy to make more are needed. 

####3) Two or three columns are all that's needed. Keeping everything on a single page simplifies the UX. Front-end Dom manipulation will simplify a user's experience, and keep everything intuitive and easily understood.
